# Bitmap Message

This program displays a text message according to a provided bitmap image. The user can input the message to be displayed, and the program will replace each non-blank character in the bitmap with a character from the message.

## Requirements

    Python 3.x

## Usage

    Clone or download the repository.
    Navigate to the project directory.
    Run `python3 bitmap_message.py`.

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the message to be displayed. Type in the message and press Enter. If you don't want to display a message, you can leave the input field blank and the program will exit.

After you enter the message, the program will display the bitmap image with the non-blank characters replaced with characters from the message. Each character in the message will be repeated as necessary to fill the entire image.

## Customization

You can customize the bitmap image by changing the bitmap variable at the top of the code. The bitmap should be a multiline string, where each line represents a row of the image. Blank spaces should be represented by spaces, and non-blank characters can be represented by any other character.
