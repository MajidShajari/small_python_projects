# Bitmap Message

This program displays a text message according to a provided bitmap image. The user can input the message to be displayed, and the program will replace each non-blank character in the bitmap with a character from the message.

## Installation

The program requires Python 3 to run. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To run the program, save the code to a file with a ".py" extension (e.g., `bitmap_message.py`). Then open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Finally, run the command python bitmap_message.py to start the program.

## Usage

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the message to be displayed. Type in the message and press Enter. If you don't want to display a message, you can leave the input field blank and the program will exit.

After you enter the message, the program will display the bitmap image with the non-blank characters replaced with characters from the message. Each character in the message will be repeated as necessary to fill the entire image.

## Customization

You can customize the bitmap image by changing the bitmap variable at the top of the code. The bitmap should be a multiline string, where each line represents a row of the image. Blank spaces should be represented by spaces, and non-blank characters can be represented by any other character.
