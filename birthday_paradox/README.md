# Birthday Paradox Simulation

This is a Python implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation of the **[Birthday Paradox]**(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem). The birthday paradox shows us that in a group of N people, the odds that two of them have matching birthdays is surprisingly large.

## Requirements

    Python 3.x

## Usage

    Clone or download the repository.
    Navigate to the project directory.
    Run `python3 birthday_paradox.py`.

The program will prompt you to enter the number of birthdays to generate (up to 100). It will then display the generated birthdays and determine if there are two birthdays that match. Finally, it will run through 100,000 simulations and display the results.
